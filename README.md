# P2P network implementation
 This is a start to my python implementation of how a p2p network should be. This is more of a journal or diary on my journey to this implementation rather than a definitive answer, so all suggestions and criticism are welcome!

## What is a P2P network?
It is a decentralized network architecture where the participants named “peers” share resources, services, or information directly with each other, without the need for a centralized server.
In a P2P network, each participant acts both as a client and a server, contributing resources such as computing power, disk storage, or network bandwidth to the network.

There are many real-world applications of the P2P network:
-Bit-torrent: which allows file sharing
-SETI@home: allows distributed computing
-Blockchains: allows the distribution of content
-Communications: such as Skype

#### Key features of a decentralized network:
1. There is no single point of failure in a P2P network. Each peer is equal and can communicate directly with the other peers
2. P2P networks can scale effectively because new peers can join without putting additional strain on a central server.
3. Since there is no central server, P2P networks are often more resilient to failures or attacks, as the network can continue to function even if some peers are offline.
4. Participants in this type of network can share their own resources(such as bandwidth, processing power, or storage space) to provide services of content to other in the network.
